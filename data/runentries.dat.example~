#
# Lines format is 'TYPE;VALUE[;TITLE]'
#
# TYPE can be 'course' or 'launch'

# TITLE is optional and defines the title shown in the Pracro Starter. If no TITLE is given
# the VALUE will be used as title.
#
# If only one runentry exists and a patient-id is given on commandline or found by the OCR
# system, Pracro will autolaunch that entry without showing the Pracro Starter dialog.
